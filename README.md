In this competition, I'll be analyzing salary data from thousands of employees globally. Using a data-driven approach, I'll explore how factors like job role, experience level, remote work, and company size impact salaries. I am eager to dig deeper into the field of data science and analysis, exploring new techniques and methodologies to enhance my expertise. Support me if you gain same insights from my analysis.
